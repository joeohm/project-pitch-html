 # Final Project Pitch Template

## **Overall idea *- example***

> We want to create a complex recipe app. Its main purpose is to add, list, save, edit and delete recipes. Users of this application will be able to create their own collections of recipes, edit/delete them via a set of controls. Moreover, there will be the possibility to create your own profile.

As for stretch goals, we want to add the functionality of adding recipes to favourites for a specific user, copying ingredient lists to the clipboard, filtering on different tags and sorting on ingredients, personalized recipe feed dependent on user activity and creating PWA from a web application.
